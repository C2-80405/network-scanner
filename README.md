This is the basic Network Scanner

It can check the number of devices connected to your network and print their local IP addresses along with their MAC addresses.




1. Sniff_Tool.py
I have used argparse and scapy to make this basic network scanner.

[Syntax : python <file_name> -ip <ip_address>/<subnet>]

[NOTE : Use it with root/administrative priviledges]


One needs to have argparse and scapy installed.
They can be installed with :
pip install argparse
pip install scapy


2. Sniff_Tool2.py
